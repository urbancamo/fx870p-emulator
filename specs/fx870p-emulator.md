# Web-based FX-870P Emulator

This is a re-implementation of this emulator in Typescript and Vue suitable for
accessing via a web page.

The source code for the Windows/Delphi implementation of an FX-870P emulator
is stored in the directory [../reference/fx870_es](../reference/fx870_es).

Your task is to rewrite the emulator so that it has the same functionality as the
original.

As a first step, examine the [documentation page](../reference/fx870_es/FX-870P_emulator.html)
and plan first steps for a re-implementation, detailing the facilities provided by the emulator
and how that might be implemented in a web-based version.

The plan should include the major functional components of the emulator, document any binaries
required, bitmaps, and supporting files that can be reused in the re-implementation.
