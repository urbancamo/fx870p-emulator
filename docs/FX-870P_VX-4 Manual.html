<a name="BASIC_OPERATION"><b>1. Basic operation</b></a><br><br>

<p>
　The batteries used by FX-870P/VX-4 are:<br>

There are two types of batteries,<a href="#ON_OFF">Press the ON key ("BRK" key) but it does not start.</a>Or, after pressing the ON key,<a href="#LOW_BATTERY">When a low battery message appears,</a>The replacement of the batteries will be required.<br>

<ol>
  <li>Screw of the metal pig of the main body Three screws are turned with coins, etc., and the metal pig is removed.</li>
  <li>When you remove the metal pig, there is a slide switch engraved with ON, OFF on the back of the main body. Turn off that switch.</li>
  <li>Slide while holding down the battery slide pig ▼ and remove the battery slide pig.</li>
  <li>Take out the old battery and set four AA batteries according to the instructions on the imprint of the inner electrode.</li>
  <li>Bring the battery slide pig back to normal.</li>
  <li>Turn on the slide switch.</li>
  <li>Put on a metal pig and tighten three screws.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<b>Replacing data storage batteries (CR1220)</b><br>
　<b>Since the life of the data storage battery is twenty-four months, it is necessary to replace it once every two years.</b>
<ol>
  <li>Screw of the metal pig of the main body Three screws are turned with coins, etc., and the metal pig is removed.</li>
  <li>When you remove the metal pig, there is a slide switch engraved with ON, OFF on the back of the main body. Turn off that switch.</li>
  <li>Since the bottom of the round press plate of about 1 inch (2.54 
cm) near the slide switch is the place where CR1220 is set, loosen the 
small screw that is fastened and remove the pressing plate.</li>
  <li>Set the battery by placing the + electrode of CR1220 on the upper side (side close to the presser when the presser is put on).</li>
  <li>Put on the press and tighten the small screws.</li>
  <li>Turn on the slide switch.</li>
  <li>Put on a metal pig and tighten three screws.</li>
</ol>
<br>

As a precaution when replacing a single battery (AA battery) or CR1220, 
leave the slide switch off during the replacement operation.<br><br>



For example, if FX-870P, VX4 cannot start "BRK" key (ON key) 
successfully before replacing the battery, for example, for reasons such
 as not using it for a long time,
Press the P button on the back of the main body and the ALL RESET button
 on the front of the main body with a thin stick on the tip like a 
toothpick.
After pressing all reset,<br><br>

If you press the "BRK" key and the message above disappears, all the 
memory is initialized and all the saved data is erased.
In the above message, the first number following "RAM:" is the capacity 
of the RAM of the main unit, and the latter number is the capacity of 
the increased RAM of RP-33, etc., and the memory capacity of 
FX-870P/VX-4 can be confirmed.<br><br>

<ul>
  <li type="disc">Shocked by the intensity of static electricity,</li>
  <li type="disc">I ran out of machine language, and the pokecon ran out of control.</li>
</ul>
It is used when it does not work normally due to the fact that it is not used.<br>
　・The P button, ALL RESET button does not obtain or analyze the schematic, so it is a guess from other materials,
Each one looks like a CPU reset and a key interrupt. Therefore,<br>
<ul>
  <li type="disc">・The P button takes a CPU reset, performs a CPU 
initialization routine, and performs the minimum setting of the CPU (for

  <li type="disc">The ALL RESET button is detected by the standard input routine of the key matrix and executes the initialization routine of RAM.</li>

<a name="LOW_BATTERY"><b>Low battery display</b></a><br>
　When the battery is exhausted and requires the replacement of the

<a name="BATTERY_CR1220">(Note)</a><br>
The model number of the button battery is determined by the 
international standard IEC60086, and the specifications of the battery 
are known. In the case of CR1220, C means that the battery system is a 
manganese dioxide lithium battery (nominal voltage: 3.0V),
R means round. 1220 represents a diameter of 12 mm and a thickness of 
2.0 mm.

<br>From the display, it can be confirmed that the internal accuracy is thirteen digits.
<br>　FX-870P/VX-4 performs rounding after arithmetic operations by default (at initialization) and <a href="https://luckleo.cocolog-nifty.com/pockecom/VX-4/HTML/fx-870p_basic_jp.html#RES_MODE">MODE10</a>.
The method of rounding,<br>
</p><ul>
  <li type="disc">When the number of 11-13 digits is less than 049, truncated,
  </li><li type="disc">When the 11-13-digit number is more than 950, rounded up
</li></ul>
is. and again,<a href="https://luckleo.cocolog-nifty.com/pockecom/VX-4/HTML/fx-870p_basic_jp.html#RES_MODE">Mode 11</a>By doing so, you can disable rounding processing after the four arithmetic operations.<br>
　To confirm the rounding process, first enable the rounding process by MODE10.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A=1.123456789049<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print using "#. ################################<br>
and execute continuously. At this time, A = 1.123456789049 is displayed,
<font color="red"><b>Constant assignments are not rounded even if the 
rounding process after arithmetic operations is effective, but it is not
 rounded.</b></font>I can confirm things.<br>
　and then,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A = A*1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print using "#. ################################<br>
and running continuously,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A=1.123456789000<br>
It can be seen that the rounding process was performed by the four arithmetic operations.<br>
　Here, an example of operation near the threshold of rounding treatment is summarized in the table below.<br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" align="CENTER">
  <caption align="CENTER"><b>Table . Calculation result example when the rounding process after four arithmetic operations is enabled<br>(FX-870P/VX-4)</b></caption>
  <tbody><tr><th>Assignment value to A</th><th>After MODE10, A = A value by A1</th><th>Rounding treatment</th></tr><tr>
  <td align="CENTER">1.123456788<font color="red">049</font></td><td align="CENTER">1.123456788<font color="red">000</font></td><td>truncated</td></tr><tr>

</tr></tbody></table><br>
Here, in order to clarify the effect of the rounding and avoid 
confusion, the value of the decimal point 9th place to be assigned 
before the calculation of the table is set to eight.<br><br>

　In addition, whether the rounding treatment is effective or invalid for FX-870P / VX-4 is in the system area<a href="https://luckleo.cocolog-nifty.com/pockecom/VX-4/HTML/fx-870p_inner_info_jp.html#TBL-1_RNDFL">RND FL</a>(Older
 name: MODED, Address: &amp;H1133)
The value of this address is zero, and the rounding process at the time 
of arithmetic operation is effective at zero, and the rounding process 
at the time of arithmetic operation is invalid in one. Specifically,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFEG=0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PEEK (&amp;H1133)<br>
So, you can check the contents. However, if you do not execute the 
DEFSEG instruction until then, the DEFSEG=0 command is unnecessary.<br>
　For details on the format of numerical variables, please refer to 12. FX-870P/VX-4 Internal Information<a href="https://luckleo.cocolog-nifty.com/pockecom/VX-4/HTML/fx-870p_inner_info_jp.html#BCD-FLOATING-POINT_FORMAT">A-2. BCD Floating-point format and internal format</a>about the reference.<br><br>

　Finally,<font color="red"><b>In the FX-890P / Z-1 of the successor machine, the rounding method is different,</b></font><br>
<ul>
  <li type="disc">When the number of 11-13 digits is less than 007, truncated,
  </li><li type="disc">When the number of 11-13 digits is 990 or more, it is rounded up
</li></ul>
And the conditions are getting tougher. The rounding conditions for 
models prior to the FX-870P/VX-4 are unknown because the author does not
 have those aircraft.<br><br><br>

(Note)<br>
In the case of Sharp's Poquecon, although PC-E500 models such as PC-E650
 can store 20digits with support for double accuracy and can be stored 
in twenty-four digits of calculation (basic is the same as conventional 
with single accuracy),
Most models are stored in twelve digits and are ten digits. The 11th and
 12th digits are rounded up, and out of the eight bytes stored in memory
 as variable values, the last byte is zero and the information is 
damaged (operations confirmed with PC-1350, PC-G850V).
Therefore, Sharp's Pokécon is a specification that makes it easy to 
accumulate errors when performing complex calculations. In Casio's 
pocketcon, as described above, it is in contrast to the preservation of 
basically thirteen-digit accuracy.<br>
　Therefore,<b>In terms of calculation accuracy, it seems that the Casio's pocketcomputer is better than Sharp.</b>
