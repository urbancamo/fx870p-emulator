# 2048

The classic sliding-tile puzzle game, implemented in Casio BASIC for the FX-870P / VX-4.

## How to Play

Slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with double the value. Reach the **2048** tile to win!

### Display

```
.    2    .    4    1234
.    .    .    .
.    .    2    .
.    .    .    2
```

- Numbers show tile values (2, 4, 8, 16, ... 2048)
- `.` marks empty cells
- Score is shown in the top-right corner

### Controls

- **4** — Slide left
- **6** — Slide right
- **8** — Slide up
- **2** — Slide down
- **Q** — Quit (shows final score)

### Rules

1. Each move slides **all** tiles in the chosen direction
2. Tiles slide as far as possible until hitting a wall or another tile
3. If two tiles with the **same value** collide, they **merge** into one tile worth double
4. Each merge adds the new tile's value to your score
5. After each move, a new tile (usually **2**, occasionally **4**) appears in a random empty cell
6. The game ends when no moves are possible (grid full, no adjacent matches)
7. You **win** when any tile reaches **2048**

### Strategy Tips

- **Pick a corner** — try to build your highest tile in one corner
- **Keep your big tile anchored** — avoid moves that dislodge it
- **Build chains** — arrange tiles in descending order along an edge
- **Avoid random moves** — plan ahead, especially when the board gets crowded
- **Use two primary directions** — e.g., mostly left and down, to maintain structure

## Running It

1. Load the program into the emulator via **LOAD** or **LIB**
2. On the calculator type `LOAD "COM0:6,N,8,1,N,N,N,N,N"` and press **EXE**
3. Switch to BASIC mode (`MODE` then select BASIC) and type `RUN`, press **EXE**
4. Press any key to start

## Program Structure

```
Lines 1-2       Title and comments
Lines 10-19     Splash screen, init grid, place first 2 tiles
Lines 100-128   Main loop: display, input, slide, check win/game-over
Lines 300-305   Slide left (4 rows through merge-left)
Lines 310-315   Slide right (reverse rows, merge-left, reverse back)
Lines 320-325   Slide up (columns through merge-left)
Lines 330-335   Slide down (reverse columns, merge-left, reverse back)
Lines 500-510   Display grid and score
Lines 700-712   Place random new tile in empty cell
Lines 800-816   Core merge-left: compact, merge pairs, compact again
Lines 900-910   Game-over detection
```

## Technical Notes

The grid is stored in a 16-element array `G()` in row-major order. All four slide directions reuse a single merge-left subroutine (`GOSUB 800`) by extracting rows or columns into a temporary array `T()`, optionally reversed. The merge algorithm: compact non-zero values leftward, merge adjacent equal pairs, compact again.
